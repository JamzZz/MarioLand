With this mod you can play as Mario, Luigi, and Wario, as well as some new additional characters coming in future updates. Not only do you get to play as those characters, donning their signature outfits, but you also get to use their moves and Power-Ups. With attack buff Power-ups such as the Fire and Ice Flowers, to movement-enhancing Power-Ups such as the Cape Feather and Frog Suit, you can go wild in your Terraria worlds while maintaining the retro-esc feel of a typical Super Mario platformer!
